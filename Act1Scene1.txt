Active Learning (subset of machine learning) is a kind of query-based learning
where the  user queries for specific information based on a certain region of interest.

The fundamental assumption behind the active learner algorithm concept is that an ML
algorithm could potentially reach a higher level of accuracy while using a smaller
number of training labels if it were allowed to choose the data it wants to learn
from.

Building CB based on AI
Instead of storing each instance in the memory the learner can exploit from  the
hypothesis postulated by AI that user has the liberty to choose the data to learn
from specific to the learning algorithm.
so in corparison to regular ML algorithm where we randomly picked up the
instances we can employ AI to  do it more smartly in an interactive approach.

examples for AI
a) Speech recognition: Accurate labeling of speech utterances is time consuming
and requires expertise, annotation at word level can take ten times longer than
actual audio, and annotating phonemes can take 400  times as long.

b) Document calssification and filtering: Learning to classify documents or any
kind of media requires that users label each document or media file with particular
labels, like relevant or irrelevant.
